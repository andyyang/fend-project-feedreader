## Why is testing important?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

## Dependencies

This project uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).
